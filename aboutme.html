Hello!
Cathy to Earth!!
Hi, my name is Cathy.
Catherine Kim to be exact.
I also have a Korean name, but none of you guys can pronounce it anyway so we'll ignore it.
I am 16 years old and I'm Korean American. I moved here when I was four years old and been living here since!
I like to listen to music, especially Kpop. I also like roller coasters and aquariums. I also like to design things such as my room, photos, and much more.
I dislike bugs, especially spiders. I also dislike big outings.
