    <p> I'm still learning but this is our first circuit! We connected multiple resistors and jumper wires to light up four different LED lights. We utilized help from the 5V starter with our normal 3.3V to be able to light up all four. The 3.3V only lit up the red ones and the green and yellow were very dimmed. </p>
